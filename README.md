# Rusty Tracer - CPU-based Ray Tracer in Rust

Rusty Tracer is a CPU-based Ray Tracer written in the Rust programming language. This project aims to provide a simple, yet efficient implementation of a ray tracer that can render stunning 3D scenes using the principles of ray tracing.

## Features

- Support for basic geometric primitives such as spheres.
- Soft shadows and reflections.
- Anti-aliasing for smoother images.
- Multithreading for faster rendering.

## Acknowledgments

- The implementation of the ray tracer is inspired by Peter Shirley's "Ray Tracing in One Weekend" series.
- Thanks to the Rust programming language community for providing excellent tools and resources.
